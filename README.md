# CS 480: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Fall 2019

## Course Description

Introduction to computational methods for intelligent control of autonomous agents, and the use of programming paradigms that support development of flexible and reactive systems. These include heuristic search, knowledge representation, constraint satisfaction, probabilistic reasoning, decision-theoretic control, and sensor interpretation. Particular focus will be places on real-world application of the material.

## Prerequisites

(CS 331 with min. grade of D and MATH 474 with min. grade of D) OR (CS 401 with min. grade of D and CS 402 with min. grade of D). MATH 474 may be taken concurrently.
